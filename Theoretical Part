What is Convex Hull ?

-Convex Hull is hull with properties that every point is either on the line of Hull or within it.Otherwise stated, there is no point which
lies out of the hull.There is varius algorithm for obtaining convex hull, some of them are: Chan's algorithm, Graham Scan,Jarvis march
QuickHull, simple "Divide-and-conquer" recursive algorithm and so on. Every mentioned algorithm is more or less iterative by its nature
only QuickHull and simple "D-A-C" are recursive algorithms.

How does it works? 

-It works using some basic math ideas from Calculus 2 and Vectors like Cross,Dot product or unit vectors.Using this ideas algorithm 
calculate which point lies where in space, and from varius option, it choose the right one in order to obtain every one of them and the end.
For example, Cross product funtions use 3 points(A,B,C) and firstly gets 2 vectors from them(AB,AC).Secondly, algorithm calculate cross
product for 2 given vectors by given formula, and if the result is positive (>=0) that means vector AC (given point C) lies on the right
side of vector AB.If the result is negative(<0) it means that vector AC(given point C) lies on the left side of vector AB.
